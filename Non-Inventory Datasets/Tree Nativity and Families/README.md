This folder currently includes Distribution Data.csv, which is used in analyzer.py.

To generate the Distribution Data.csv and run POWO.py, you need to download the wcvp.zip folder from Royal Botanic Gardens, KEW Plants of the World Online (POWO) and move Distribution.csv and Names.csv inot this folder. They are not included here because of their large file size.
